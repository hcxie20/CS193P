# CS193P

Developing iOS7 Apps for iPhone and iPad, Fall 2013
Objective-c class

# Branches:
For each homework assignment, there is a corresponding branch HW1/2/... for that.  
Specially, for HW1, try branch 8f908536adedae5a157452b07b2130baa41e8dca. I forgot to create this branch..

# Homeworks: 
## HW1

Basic staffs. Create a simple view having 12 cards, each cards drawed randomly from a deck you initialized. All staffs can be found in Lec 3.

## HW2

Goal: Create a card-matching game.

Logger: A simple Singleton based log system. Allow us use 
```
#import "Logger.h"

[Logger Info:@""]
```
to create and store log in any file. 


Did not try Extra Credit 1: add UISlider to control log info history. Should be easy if you provided some more interface for the logger (return log entry at some specific index).

When the hack am I going to learn build UI w/ codes only...
